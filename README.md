# Employee_Attrition_model
Employee Attrition Model is a project focused on analyzing and predicting employee attrition rates within a company. By utilizing logistic regression analysis, this project aims to provide insights into factors contributing to employee turnover and develop strategies for retention.

Overview
Objective: The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model for employee attrition, enabling companies to proactively address retention challenges and implement targeted strategies for mitigating attrition risks.

Tools & Technologies: Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.

Key Features
Logistic Regression Model: The project employs the logistic regression algorithm from scikit-learn to construct a predictive model. Utilizing pandas and numpy, we preprocess the dataset to train the model effectively.

Accuracy: The model achieves a robust accuracy of 80 percent in predicting employee attrition, providing valuable insights into potential turnover risks.

Data Visualization: Matplotlib and seaborn are utilized for data visualization, facilitating the understanding of trends and patterns in the dataset.
